Purpose of PHP
==============
    1.PHP is primarily used for server-side web development. 
        It enables the creation of dynamic web pages by embedding PHP code within HTML.

    1.Dynamic Typing: PHP is dynamically typed, meaning you donâ€™t need to declare the 
                data type of a variable explicitly.
    2.Database Integration: PHP provides built-in support for interacting with databases, 
                            such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and others.

Advantages of PHP
================
    1.Open Source: PHP is an open-source language, making it freely available for use and distribution. 
                    This encourages a large community of developers, contributing to its growth and improvement.
    2.Easy to Learn: PHP syntax is similar to C and other programming languages, 
                     making it relatively easy for developers to learn, 
                     especially for those with a background in programming.
    3.Web Integration: PHP is designed specifically for web development and is embedded within HTML. 
                    It seamlessly integrates with various web technologies, 
                    facilitating the creation of dynamic and interactive web pages.

                     crucial aspect of many web applications.

Disadvantages
=============
     1.Security Concerns: If not handled properly, PHP code may be susceptible to security vulnerabilities, 
                        such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). 
                        Developers need to be cautious and follow best practices to secure PHP applications.
