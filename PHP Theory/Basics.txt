Case sensitive in Php
=======================
PHP is partially case-sensitive. PHP constructs, function names, class names are case-insensitive, whereas variables are case-sensitive. 
A statement ends with a semicolon (;). Whitespace and line breaks don't matter in PHP; do leverage them to make the code more readable

In PHP, keyword (e.g., echo, if, else, while), functions, user-defined functions, classes are not case-sensitive. 
However, all variable names are case-sensitive.

In the below example, you can see that all three echo statements are equal and valid:
Example:-
<!DOCTYPE>  
<html>  
    <body>  
        <?php  
            echo "Hello world using echo </br>";  
            ECHO "Hello world using ECHO </br>";  
            EcHo "Hello world using EcHo </br>";  
        ?>  
    </body>  
</html>  

Output :- 
Hello world using echo
Hello world using ECHO
Hello world using EcHo

Example2:-
<html>  
    <body>  
        <?php  
            $color = "black";  
            echo "My car is ". $ColoR ."</br>";  
            echo "My dog is ". $color ."</br>";  
            echo "My Phone is ". $COLOR ."</br>";  
        ?>  
    </body>  
</html>
