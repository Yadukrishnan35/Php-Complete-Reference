constants
=========
PHP constants are name or identifier that can't be changed during the execution of the script except for magic constants, which are not really constants. 
PHP constants can be defined by 2 ways:

1.Using define() function
2.Using const keyword

Constants are similar to the variable except once they defined, they can never be undefined or changed. 
They remain constant across the entire program. 
PHP constants follow the same PHP variable rules. 
For example, it can be started with a letter or underscore only.

define() 
=======
define(name, value, case-insensitive)
1.name: It specifies the constant name.
2.value: It specifies the constant value.
3.case-insensitive: Specifies whether a constant is case-insensitive. 
    Default value is false. It means it is case sensitive by default.

<?php  
define("MESSAGE","Hello JavaTpoint PHP");  
echo MESSAGE;  
?>  
Output
======
Hello JavaTpoint PHP


Example 2:-
Create a constant with case-insensitive name:
<?php    
define("MESSAGE","Hello JavaTpoint PHP",true);//not case sensitive    
echo MESSAGE, "</br>";    
echo message;    
?>    

Hello JavaTpoint PHP
Hello JavaTpoint PHP

example 3:-
<?php  
define("MESSAGE","Hello JavaTpoint PHP",false);//case sensitive  
echo MESSAGE;  
echo message;  
?>  
Output:-
========
Hello JavaTpoint PHP
Notice: Use of undefined constant message - assumed 'message' 
in C:\wamp\www\vconstant3.php on line 4
message


const
=======
PHP constant: const keyword
PHP introduced a keyword const to create a constant. The const keyword defines constants at compile time.
 It is a language construct, not a function. The constant defined using const keyword are case-sensitive.

 <?php  
const MESSAGE="Hello const by JavaTpoint PHP";  
echo MESSAGE;  
?>  
Hello const by JavaTpoint PHP
